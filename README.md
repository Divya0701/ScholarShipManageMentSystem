A Novel ScholarShip System

In the traditional scholarship system, students are given scholarship equally based on one factor (attendance) alone which is not holistic approach as there are many more factors that can be considered like CGPA , participation in sports and co-curricular events .

Our main aim is to develop a web application which tracks down the academic performance and co-curricular activities (CGPA,attendance,sports) of the students and based on those credentials, computing the scholarship they earned.
